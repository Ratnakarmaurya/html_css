    <!-- the problem is that the more images like this you're gonna have on a page the slower the loading time is going to be and slower your loading times are while the faster the users are just going to drop your site.And that's not something that we're looking for and we have again multiple solutions.Technically we could use a application like Photoshop where we could crop image or we can use the os inbuilt tools to do the job -->
